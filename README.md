# MollySocket

MollySocket allows getting signal notifications via [UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org/). It works like a linked device, which doesn't have an encryption key, connected to the Signal server. Everytime it receives an encrypted event, it notifies your mobile via UnifiedPush.

## Setup

1. You need the right flavor of Molly to use UnifiedPush: <https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android-unifiedpush>.
2. You can install MollySocket via:
    1. Docker/Podman: `docker pull ghcr.io/mollyim/mollysocket:latest`
    2. Crates.io: `cargo install mollysocket` (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the setup) 
    3. Direct download: <https://github.com/mollyim/mollysocket/releases> (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the setup)
3. A [distributor app](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/) (easiest is [ntfy](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/))

You can optionally install your own push server like ntfy or NextPush.
For beginners, you can use a free service like ntfy.sh (do consider donating if you have the means).

## Configuration

MollySocket web server does not provide TLS. It should be accessible behind a reverse proxy.

It is possible to use MollySocket without the web server: see the Air Gapped mode on Android settings.
In this mode MollySocket doesn't 

### Environment variables
* `ROCKET_PORT` : port used by the webserver.
* `MOLLY_CONF` : path to the configuration file.
* `RUST_LOG` : log level.

### Configuration file

The configuration file uses the [TOML format](https://toml.io/). Below is an overview of configuration options.

| Option            | Description                                       | Examples                                                | Default              |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| allowed_endpoints | List of UnifiedPush servers                       | `["*"]`,`["https://yourdomain.tld", "https://ntfy.sh"]` | `["http://0.0.0.0"]` |
| allowed_uuids     | UUIDs of signal accounts that may use this server | `["*"]`, `["abcdef-12345-tuxyz-67890"]`                 | `["*"]`              |
| db                | Path to the DB                                    | `"/data/ms.sqlite"`                                     | `db.sqlite`          |

#### `allowed_endpoints`

These are the UnifiedPush endpoints that MollySocket may use to push notifications with. 

**Note that, for security reasons, endpoints on your local network must be allowed explicitly**. If you self-host your push server, add it to the `allowed_endpoints`.

As [per spec](https://unifiedpush.org/spec/server/), an endpoint is an [IRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier).
Examples:
 - `http://localhost`
 - `https://mydomain.tld`
 - `https://mydomain.tld:443`
 - `https://ntfy.sh/mySecretSubscription`

You can thus be very open and allow everything with `["*"]` or be increasingly specific even defining which subscription should be used.
The subscription URI can be found in your distributor app.

#### `allowed_uuids`

You can allow registration for all accounts by setting `allowed_uuids` to `['*']`. Else set your account ids in the array: `['account_id1','account_id2']`.

The account IDs are showing in the Molly application under Settings > Notifications > UnifiedPush.
You may need to activate UnifiedPush first before your account ID is shown.

### Android
* If MollySocket webserver is not accessible from the Internet, you can enable the **Air Gapped** mode. You will have to register your connection manually on MollySocket.
* Every time MollySocket receives a(n encrypted) data : it notifies Molly via UnifiedPush if it hasn't notified the last 5 seconds. Then Molly open the websocket for 60secs.


## About security

**Relative to Signal security**

MollySocket receives the credentials for a linked device and does not receive any encryption key. Which means:
* Someone with access to MollySocket database can't change the identity key, to impersonate users. See [setKeys](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/blob/v8.67.0/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/textsecuregcm/controllers/KeysController.java#L111).
* Someone with access to MollySocket database may be able to use the credentials of linked devices to spam the Signal server and hit the rate limits. I haven't checked if this would temporarily block the account or just the linked device. (Availability risk)
* Someone with access to MollySocket database may be able to change some account field in a destructive way. For instance changing the account Name to something random. The cleartext will be random since these field are encrypted and require encryption keys to be properly encrypted.
