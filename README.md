# MollySocket

MollySocket allows getting signal notifications via [UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org/). It works like a linked device, which doesn't have an encryption key, connected to the Signal server. Everytime it receives an encrypted event, it notifies your mobile via UnifiedPush.

## Setup

1. You need the right flavor of Molly to use UnifiedPush: <https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android-unifiedpush>.
2. You can install MollySocket via:
    1. Docker/Podman: `docker pull ghcr.io/mollyim/mollysocket:latest`
    2. Crates.io: `cargo install mollysocket` (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the setup) 
    3. Direct download: <https://github.com/mollyim/mollysocket/releases> (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the setup)
3. A [distributor app](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/) (easiest is [ntfy](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/))

You can optionally install your own push server like ntfy or NextPush.
For beginners, you can use a free service like ntfy.sh (do consider donating if you have the means).

## Web Server

MollySocket exposes a web server so that Molly can send the information it needs to operate. You must configure TLS with a reverse proxy in front of MollySocket. Molly can only connect to the server over HTTPS.

It is possible to use MollySocket without the web server, but you will have to manually register the information MollySocket needs: see the **Air Gapped** mode on Android settings.

## Configuration

The configuration file uses the [TOML format](https://toml.io/). Below is an overview of configuration options. You can configure each parameter using either the conf file, the environment variable or the cli option (if available).

| Parameter (conf. file) | Environment variable       | Cli Option  | Description                                       | Default              | Examples                                                |

\* Takes the precedence

#### `allowed_endpoints`

These are the UnifiedPush endpoints that MollySocket may use to push notifications with. 

⚠️ **If you self-host your push server, add your push server to the `allowed_endpoints`.** ⚠️

That's because, for security reasons, endpoints on your local network must be allowed explicitly. You just have to set the scheme (https), the domain and the port if required. For instance `allowed_endpoints=['https://push.mydomain.tld']`

#### `allowed_uuids`

You can allow registration for all accounts by setting `allowed_uuids` to `['*']`. Else set your account ids in the array: `['account_id1','account_id2']`.

The account IDs are showing in the Molly application under Settings > Notifications > UnifiedPush.
You need to activate UnifiedPush first before your account ID is shown.

## Troubleshoot

* **On the Android app, the status states _MollySocket server not found_**

You haven't entered the right url.

This must be the one where MollySocket is reachable. To test it, open the link you have entered in a browser: you should see a json containing the version of MollySocket. For instance `{"mollysocket":{"version":"1.2.0"}}`.

If you can access the web server, make sure it is accessible over HTTPS. Molly can't connect to the server over HTTP.

* **On the Android app, the status states _The account ID is refused by the server_**

You have restricted the allowed account ID who can use your MollySocket server.

Add your account ID[1] to _allowed_uuids_ to allow your account, or add a wildcard `["*"]` to allow all the accounts to use your server. See [Configuration](#configuration) to configure your server correctly.

[1] Your account ID can be copied on the Android app, under the UnifiedPush settings

* **On the Android app, the status states _The endpoint is forbidden by the server_**

You have restricted the allowed UnifiedPush endpoints, or you are using a self-hosted server you haven't whitelisted.

Add your server to the _allowed_endpoints_: `["https://push.mydomain.tld"]`. _This is NOT your MollySocket URL_ but the one from your push provider. See [Configuration](#configuration) to configure your server correctly.

* **I use the Air-gapped mode and I don't receive notifications**.

If you use air-gapped mode, then Molly (android) can't test the setup and it assumes you have correctly setup everything. You should double check that the account ID is accepted by your mollysocket server and the endpoint is allowed by your mollysocket server (check the output logs).

## About security

**Relative to Signal security**

**MollySocket never has any encryption key**

MollySocket receives the credentials for a linked device and does not receive any encryption key. Which means:
* Someone with access to MollySocket database can't change the identity key, to impersonate users. See [setKeys](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/blob/v8.67.0/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/textsecuregcm/controllers/KeysController.java#L111).
* Someone with access to MollySocket database may be able to use the credentials of linked devices to spam the Signal server and hit the rate limits. I haven't checked if this would temporarily block the account or just the linked device. (Availability risk)
* Someone with access to MollySocket database may be able to change some account field in a destructive way. For instance changing the account Name to something random. The cleartext will be random since these field are encrypted and require encryption keys to be properly encrypted.
